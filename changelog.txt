Version 3.5.9
Minor update with major background features
  + Leave messages are now randomized, Flutterbot isn't a complete bitch to everyone anymore.
  + Background music functionality is in the works. Streaming works, so all we need is the queue system.
  + Very, very unstable /request code has been added, however, due to how volatile it is, the command is currently disabled
  + /play and /stop are in experimental modes, and are currently disabled. Zuris and I may use the commands for testing, but you guys won't be able to use it yet.
  + A few bugfixes here and there.
  + Alot of old, unused code lines have been removed.
