Version 4.0.0
Massive update to the bot:
• All database-using commands have been updated to perform asynchronously instead of synchronously, meaning there should no longer be issues where Sirabot will hang if she disconnects from the database.
• Booru has been updated to version 1.2.0, and Mongoose has been updated to version 5.2.13.
• Some commands have had their output beautified or normalised.
• Warnings have been moved to their own collection in the database, making them much easier for the bot to access.
• All code has been reformatted and tidied up.
• *Finally that damn "[object Object]" error she keeps crashing with has been made more readable, meaning a quick fix should be on its way soon: look out for that.*
