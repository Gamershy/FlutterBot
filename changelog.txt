Version 3.0.2
  // Small Improvement update
  + `/stats` can now target other users. Using it without targeting will display your own stats.
  + `/reward` now actually tells what you earned. Thought that'd be nice
  + To re-clarify: `\\` is not supported. But `\` is.
  - Probably broke like, 50 things with this update, we'll see =3
