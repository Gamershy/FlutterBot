Version 2.4.0
+ Added /botwatch command, this will let you see further bot commands. Type this command in chat to get pinged for each update to Flutterbot
+ Added /togdm, this command will give you a role that'll let others know you don't wish to be DM'd. Please not that they still can DM you.
+ Added /lemmemoan, this command will automatically add the "Voice Fapper" role to you.
// All of these commands are **Toggles**, enter them once to gain the role, enter them again to remove the role.

~ Planned Features
- Finally make /spin functional
- Maybe work on music. Probably not, tbh
- Delete AI Cores for safety of the human race


~ Distant plans
- Add minigames (D&D, RPG, Horse Racing)
- Add a currency system, so I can steal your money- Imean, so you can buy worthless ingame items (No I won't do microtransactions.)
- Maybe one day actually make Flutterbot have a simple AI.
