Version 4.0.0
  +++ FINALLY ADDED MUSIC FUNCTIONALITY (Thanks Zur)
      + Added command: /play
          pretty self explanitory. Plays the specified song searched from YouTube, or adds to a queue if a song is already playing.
      + Added command: /skip
          Instantly skips any song you added, otherwise initiates a skip vote.
      + Added command: /queue
          View the queue at any time.
      + Added command: /shuffle
          vote to fully randomize the queue.
  + Admins have access to vote bypassing commands. ADMINS, DO NOT ABUSE THIS PRIVALIGE!
  + Fixed a couple errors in some admin only things.
  + Bob Ross night is coming back =3
  - removed rogue AI
