    ~ Gives you a new color, assuming you're a "Daily Fapper" or above (New rank role)
    ~ SYNTAX: `/color <color>`
    ~ Use `/removecolor <color>` before changing colors
  + Added new rank roles!
    ~ Level 10 = Newcummer - No special perms
    ~ Level 20 = Daily Fapper - Ability to change colors using /color
    ~ Level 40 = Addicted to Porn - No new perms yet
    ~ Level 70 = Pervert - No new perms yet
    ~ Level 100 = God of Lewdness - Highest possible rank
    ~ Remember: Levels are alot easier to get with Flutterbot, this may seem daunting, but it won't take long.
  + Added new pages to /commands
    ~ SYNTAX: /commands <page>
  + Added new prefix support
    ~ Flutterbot currently supports the following prefixes: `/`, `\\`, `>`, `!`, `?`, `%`, `$`, `#`, `=`, `+`
    ~ For simplicity, all syntax examples will continue to use `/` as a prefix
  + Oh look, this changelog is actually accurate this time, how bout that
